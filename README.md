# To-Do-List-App
I have created a To-do List App with the help of html ,css and javascript. A To-Do List App is a productivity tool designed to help users organize, manage, and prioritize tasks effectively. 

Key Features:
Task Creation: Quickly add tasks with titles, descriptions, and optional due dates.

Task Organization: Group tasks by categories, projects, or tags for easier navigation.

Priority Levels: Mark tasks as high, medium, or low priority to focus on what matters most.

Due Dates & Reminders: Set deadlines and receive notifications to stay on schedule.

Recurring Tasks: Automatically repeat tasks on a daily, weekly, or custom schedule.

Checklists & Subtasks: Break large tasks into smaller steps for better manageability.

Progress Tracking: Mark tasks as completed and track overall productivity.

Sync & Cloud Backup: Access your to-do list across multiple devices with real-time sync.

Collaboration (optional): Share task lists with others for team or household coordination.




Common Use Cases:
Personal Task Management: Stay on top of daily chores, errands, or personal goals.

Work & Projects: Track deadlines, assignments, and project milestones.

Academic Planning: Organize homework, exam schedules, and study plans.

Shopping Lists: Create and reuse lists for groceries or other purchases.

Habit Tracking: Use recurring tasks to build and reinforce positive routines.
